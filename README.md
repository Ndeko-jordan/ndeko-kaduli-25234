1. What is Logging?
   ----------------
Logging is the process of recording information about the events that happen within an application. This information is stored in a log file or a logging system and can include details such as errors, warnings, informational messages, and debug messages.

3. Why Logging is Important
   ------------------------
Logging is crucial for several reasons:

Debugging and Troubleshooting: Logs help developers identify and fix bugs by providing detailed information about the application's behavior.
Monitoring and Performance Analysis: Logs can provide insights into the performance of the application, helping to identify bottlenecks or inefficient code.
Security and Auditing: Logs can be used to track access to resources, monitor for unusual activity, and provide a record of events for auditing purposes.
Compliance: Certain industries have regulatory requirements that mandate logging of specific types of information.


3. Understanding Logging Levels
   ----------------------------
Logging levels indicate the severity or importance of the messages being logged. Common logging levels include:

TRACE: Very fine-grained information, typically for debugging purposes.
DEBUG: Detailed information on the flow through the system, useful during development.
INFO: Informational messages that highlight the progress of the application.
WARN: Indication of potential issues or unexpected situations.
ERROR: Error events that might still allow the application to continue running.
FATAL: Severe error events that will presumably lead to the application aborting
